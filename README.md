## Topicity project Hacked in Groningen
This repository holds part of the code created for the Topicity project, during the Hacked in Groningen hackaton.

Topicity is a solution to manage small electricity networks. A producer creates a small power plant consisting of, for example, solar cells combined with a diesel generator, or water power. 

Consumers have a smart meter in the house, which monitors electricity use. It is a pre-paid system. Consumers buy electricity credits using mobile money. The smart meter monitors electricity usage and substracts credits. When the credits run out, the electricity stops flowing. That makes it a low-risk system for the consumer, as there will be no unexpected bills.

The smart meter sends the usage data to a central system using Lora technology. There, it is aggregared. The consumer can see how much she is using through a mobile app, which shows usage by minute, hour, daily and weekly. Therefore, the user becomes aware of the electricity usage.

For the producer, the system has a low initial investment, combined with a predictable revenue flow, and detailed usage information which makes it easy to manage the system. The producer can enticipate demand, and plan for increasing the scale.

In total, Topicity makes for a systainable and scalable business model, that can bring power to the people.
